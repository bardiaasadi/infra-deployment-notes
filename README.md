# Infrastructure & Deployment Notes

This repository contains selected notes, patterns, and small utilities derived from
real-world work on cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes, identity, and SaaS deployments.

The focus is not on polished libraries or demo projects, but on:
- understanding system behavior
- operational decision-making
- deployment reliability
- configuration drift, cost, and security trade-offs

Most examples are Azure-centric, with general principles applicable across cloud platforms.
